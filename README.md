# AI-Powered Voice-Based Smart Home Automation System for Indian Languages

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered voice-based smart home automation system designed for Indian regional languages and English.  
It enables real-time control of legacy home appliances using natural language voice commands.

The system integrates AI-based speech recognition, NLP-driven command processing, and IoT hardware to achieve end-to-end automation.


## System Architecture

The AI-Powered Voice-Based Smart Home Automation System follows a layered architecture that integrates voice processing, AI-based decision-making, and IoT-based device control.

### High-Level Architecture
The overall system architecture consists of four major components:
- Voice Input & NLP Processing
- IoT Command Execution
- Response Buffer & User Feedback
- AI/Data Analytics for intelligent suggestions

### NLP Processing Pipeline
Voice commands are processed through a structured NLP pipeline to ensure accurate interpretation and execution.

Steps involved:
1. Voice Pre-processing
2. User Authentication
3. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
4. Intent Recognition
5. Command Execution
